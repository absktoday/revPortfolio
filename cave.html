        <h3>
            The Problem
        </h3>
        <p>
            The domain of artistic event management is decentralized and usually 
            organized on a 1-on-1 basis (with one side being the artist, the other  
            being the venue).This lack of a centralized platform to connect local 
            artists, venues, and potential consumers creates an inefficient economy 
            that limits the growth of local art industries as a whole. Local artists 
            have to network on their own in order to find venues interested in 
            performers, often relying on cold calls or visits. Most of the time, 
            this impedes the artists from dedicating full time to their true calling. 
            Similarly, venues looking for artists that are appropriate for their 
            clientele had no centralized listings of available artists to select from, 
            and no real way to evaluate any prospective performers. There are some 
            existing applications that feature events, but these primarily highlight 
            large events with well known artists; however, any information about smaller, 
            less formal events is either nonexistent, or buried and difficult to browse. 
            We believe our app delivers where other apps have failed to revolutionize and 
            grow the local art scene in the same way technology has transformed other 
            industries such as dating and the ride-sharing economy.
        </p>

            The goal of this project was to release a fully functional app for 
            both iOS and Android where artists and venues can connect to create 
            and promote events/shows, while the general public can find these 
            happening in their area. Our app provides artists with exposure to 
            both prospective spaces to express themselves, and a fan base to be 
            present for them; thus allowing artists to make a living sharing their 
            creative work with the world. Venues looking for local artists to 
            enrich the experience their establishment provides can browse through 
            listings of performers looking for gigs to find the type of artists 
            their clientele might enjoy, as well as seeing reviews of their past 
            performances to ensure that the experience provided will be a positive 
            one for their patrons. Finally, our app brought a whole new level of 
            entertainment offering for the general public.
